# Java GUI Project
 
Things Learned:
         JFrame is the main window that holds everything
         ImageIcon is used to load images, which can be set as icons for the window
         setSize() sets the dimensions of the window
         setDefaultCloseOperation() defines what happens when the window is closed
         setLayout(null) means we are not using any layout manager, allowing for absolute positioning
         setVisible(true) makes the window visible to the user
         JButton is a clickable button that can be added to the JFrame
         JCheckbox is a box that can be checked or unchecked, also added to the JFrame
         JRadioButton is a button that can be selected, used for options (those circles you can click)
         JTextField is a text input field where users can type
         JLabel is a text label that can display information to the user
         ActionListener is an interface that allows us to define what happens when an action occurs, like clicking a button
         getText() retrieves the text from a JTextField
         setText() sets the text of a JLabel or JTextField
         setBounds() sets the position and size of components in the JFrame
         add() is used to add components to the JFrame
         isEmpty() checks if a string is empty, useful for validation
         setIconImage() sets the icon for the JFrame, enhancing the visual appeal
         getResource() is used to load resources like images from the classpath
